## About Me

Hi, I am _Ishwar Rimal_
I have close to **8 years** of experience in the software industry. I've been wokring mostly at startups and have recently joined a product based MNC.
I have been working predominantly in the frontend tech stacks with some basics hands on experience on backend as well.

Recently I've given quite a few interviews and have prepared a interview guide for myself, which I think will be helpful for everyone.

With my experience as a candiate and also an interviewer who has been taking interviews from more than 5 years, I have curated a lot of contents from all over the internet and created this course.

## How this Course is structured

There are 5 different folders in this repo:

1. [**CSS**](https://github.com/ishwarrimal/frontend-interview-preps/tree/main/CSS)
2. **DSA**
3. [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/ishwarrimal/frontend-interview-preps/tree/main/JavaScript)
4. [**React**](https://github.com/ishwarrimal/frontend-interview-preps/tree/main/React)
5. [**Web Fundamentals**](https://github.com/ishwarrimal/frontend-interview-preps/tree/main/Web%20Fundamentals)
   Each folder contains information about the content.
